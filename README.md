# Overview

***Bawoosh***, the barely working shell. No claims are made that this is
POSIX-compliant or even enjoyable to use, but it *does* work. And, really, what
more can you ask for?

# Usage

```
python bawoosh.py
â†’ echo Hello, world!
Hello, world!
```

# Todo

As bawoosh is the barely working shell, there are a lot of unimplemented
features. Feel free to open up a pull request for any of these, it would be
much appreciated.
